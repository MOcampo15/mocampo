                is the study of engineering relating to the creation,
                design and maintenance of software programs. Software Engineering first arose in the computer science world
                as a way to fix and maintain low-quality software projects in the 1960's but as of now it's grown into 
                one of the most important areas of computer science.
                </p>
                <p> It's significant because specific software is needed in every industry nowadays, in different types
                of businesses. The demand for software engineers is increasing every day because new technology is constantly being
